# London Bike Share Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing the usage data of the bike sharing scheme in London, UK. The goal is to gain insights into the patterns and trends of bike usage across the city, which can be valuable for the bike share operator, city planners, and users.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes the publicly available data from the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset/data). The specific datasets used are:

1. **Bike Point Data**: Information about the bike docking stations, including their locations, capacities, and status.
2. **Bike Hire Data**: Records of bike rentals, including the start and end times, station IDs, and user types.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Fetch the bike point and bike hire data.
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and formatting the data as needed.
   - Combine the bike point and bike hire data to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Analyze the spatial distribution of bike docking stations and their usage.
   - Investigate temporal patterns in bike rentals, such as hourly, daily, and seasonal trends.
   - Explore user demographics and their impact on bike usage.

3. **Insights and Visualizations**:
   - Generate informative visualizations, such charts, and graphs, to communicate the key findings.
   - Identify areas for potential improvement in the bike share system, such as station placement, maintenance, and user engagement.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Tableau for interactive dashboard
  

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to execute the data analysis and generate the visualizations.
